# Expo

A React Native app built in Expo with React Native and GraphQL. I built this project for learning purposes, but also to solve specific issues encountered by my fiancee, who struggled finding something that fit her needs. The app is not tested, nor meant to be used on platforms other than iOS or by the public. With that said, the bare minimum threshhold of care has been put into making sure the app could be run by all platforms.

## The Process
I started by composing a list of wants and wishes from my primary client - my fiancee. I then decided to build the foundation of backend first before I move on to the frontend. Once I had basic queries and mutations I created the Expo project and tested my backend there.
